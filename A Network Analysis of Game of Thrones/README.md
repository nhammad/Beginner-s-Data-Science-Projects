In this project, I looked at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). I evaluated how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

Pandas/DataFrames, the networkx package and different network centrality measures were used.
