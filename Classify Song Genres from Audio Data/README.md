# Classify Song Genres from Audio Data

In this project, I tried to classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves. I used algorithms machine learning algorithms like decision trees and logistic regression.

## Dataset:

We have two datasets. One provides metadata about a song while the other one gives information regarding musical features of each track such as danceability and acousticness on a scale from -1 to 1.

## Tools:

* Python
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  
 * Jupyter Notebook
