# Movie Similiarity from Plot Summaries

In this project, I tried to predict which movies are similar to each other on the basis of their plot summaries. I used Natural Language Processing techniques likes tokenization, stemming, and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). 

## Dataset:

The dataset consisted of several movie titles along with their plot summaries from both, Wikipedia as well as IMDB. 

## Tools:

* Python
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - NLTK
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Scipy
  
 * Jupyter Notebook
